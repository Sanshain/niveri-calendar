# niveri-calendar

Once on codepen I came across a [simple calendar](https://codepen.io/m4r1vs/pen/MOOxyE) with an amazing design and couldn't pass it by. Its author is [Marius Niveri](https://github.com/m4r1vs/). He didn't post this code either on github or npm. But he inspired me so much that I decided to do it. And so that the author does not sink into obscurity, I named him in his honor

This is the simplest calendar for react/react projects, which weighs only 5 kb after minification, but looks very cool. But if you need a full-fledged calendar with the ability to restrict the user in the choice of dates and other configurable things, it probably won't suit you



## About the base template: 

- Usage styled components via [`goober`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/goober) with minimal runtime (look [`App.jsx`](https://github.com/Sanshain/preact-boilerplate/blob/main/source/App.jsx)) 
- Isolated styles via postcss modules (like `react-css-modules`)
- Typescript out of the box (`ts-config` branch)
- `preact-routers` out of the box
- prerender out of the box

- Created on Preact 10.* + Rollup 2.* + Babel 7 template for SPAs.
